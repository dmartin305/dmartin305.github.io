# abstract: "Head worn displays (HWDs) can provide a discreet method of captioning for people who are d/Deaf or hard of hearing (DHH); however, group conversations remain a difficult scenario as the wearer has difficulty in determining who is speaking and where to look. Using an HWD emulator during a group conversation, we compare eight DHH users’ perceptions of four conditions: an 80 degree field-of-view (FOV) HWD that pins captioning text to each speaker (Registered), a HWD where the captioning remains in the same place in the user’s visual field (Non-registered), Non-registered plus indicators as to which direction the current speaker is relative to the user’s line of sight (Indicators), and a control of captions displayed on a Phone. Preference increased in order of Phone, Non-registered, Indicators, and Registered. While an 80 degree FOV HWD is not practical to create in a pair of normal looking eyeglasses, pilot testing with 12 hearing participants suggests a FOV between 20 and 30 degrees might be sufficient."
