abstract: "Many products attempt to provide captioning for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals through smart glasses using automatic speech recognition. Yet there still remain challenges due to system delays and dropouts, heavy accents, and general mistranscriptions. Due to the imperfections of automatic speech recognition, there remains conversational difficulties for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals when conversing with hearing individuals. For instance, hearing conversation partners may often not realize that their Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing conversation partner is missing parts of the conversation. This study examines whether providing visual feedback of captioned conversation to hearing conversation partners can enhance conversational accuracy and dynamics. Through a task-based experiment involving 20 hearing participants we measure the impact on visual feedback of captioning on error rates, self-corrections, and subjective workloads. Our findings indicate that when given visual feedback, the average number of errors made by participants was 1.15 less (p = 0.00258) indicating a notable reduction in errors. When visual feedback is provided, the average number of self-corrections increased by 3.15 (p < 0.001), suggesting a smoother and more streamlined conversation These results show that the inclusion of visual feedback in conversation with a Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individual can lead to improved conversational efficiency."
