abstract: "The advent of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has made real-time captioning for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) community possible, and integration of ASR into Head-worn Displays (HWD) is gaining momentum. We propose a demonstration of an open source, Android-based, captioning toolkit intended to help researchers and early adopters more easily develop interfaces and test usability. Attendees will briefly learn about the the technical architecture, use-cases and features of the toolkit as well as have the opportunity to experience using the captioning glasses on the tooz HWD while engaging in conversation with the demonstrators."
