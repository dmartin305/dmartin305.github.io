Hi! I'm David Martin, an undergraduate at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA.

I am interested in creating technologies that provide access for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing individuals as well as sign language centric systems. 

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4: **Paul Erdős (0)** coauthored [*Egyptian Fractions with Each Denominator Having Three Distinct Prime Divisors*](http://math.colgate.edu/~integers/p51/p51.Abstract.html) with **Ronald L. Graham (1)**, who coauthored [*How to play the Majority game with a liar*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.disc.2009.05.011) with **Jia Mao (2)**, who coauthored [*BELT: Bluejeans codE Leak deTection*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3386527.3406727) with **Thad Starner (3)**, who coauthored [*FingerSpeller: Camera-Free Text Entry Using Smart Rings for American Sign Language Fingerspelling Recognition*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3597638.3614491) with **David Martin (4)**.
