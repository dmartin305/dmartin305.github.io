Hi! I'm David Martin, an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. I am interested in creating technologies that provide access for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals, sign language centric systems, and identifying avenues of accessibility in emerging technologies. 

Currently, I am an Undergraduate Researcher in the Contextual Computing Group (CCG) under wearable computing pioneer, [Thad Starner](https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/). Within the CCG, I have worked on captioning glasses, text-entry systems using smart rings to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling, constructing sign language datasets, and creating sign language games using ASL recognition for hearing parents of DHH children. 

Previously, I was an Undergraduate in the [Bhamla Lab](https://bhamla.gatech.edu/) under [Saad Bhamla](https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/directory/person/saad-bhamla) where I worked on creating low cost hearing-aids and mobile hearing diagnostic tests. I also Interned at Microsoft Research under [Danielle Bragg](https://danibragg.com/) where I explored ASL dictionary systems to accommodate queries with partial linguistic information.

A fun fact for math geek readers, my [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4:
